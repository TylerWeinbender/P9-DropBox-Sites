###Side Notes

  - Just to re-iterate -- **Site-44 DOES NOT support PHP or dynamic content. Static content only.**

##Drop Pages

###How-To Install

  1. Go to [Drop Pages](http://www.droppages.com) homepage.
  2. Click on **Getting Started**.

  7. Now you'll see your domain name. Click **Publish now** on the right side.
  8. You can now follow that url and be presented with a default "Hello World" page. **It works!**
