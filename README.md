## DropBox

A synopsis of Dropbox's capabilites found at [Mac Life.](http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_host_your_website_dropbox)
> Dropbox has become one of the ultimate tools to store and sync your files across multiple computers, and it's got a ton of hidden features, like the ability to host your website from a Dropbox account. While you're limited to plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can't run PHP. So if you use iWeb or hard code your website, you absolutely can use Dropbox to host it.

### How-To
  1. Upload site to **PUBLIC** folder.
  2. Right click **Copy Public** link.
  3. Click on **Copy to Clipboard**.
  4. Paste URL into address bar. 
  5. Enjoy your site!

### Pros
  - Dropbox is free for anyone. 
  - Ease of use, i.e. Drag and drop files for site to work.
  - Dropbox UI is easily navigatable. 
  - No third party software.

### Cons
  - It is free. 
  - Not as secure as a web hosting server (which can provide their own security).
  - Very limited storage.
  - If Dropbox goes down, so does your site.

##Site-44

From Site-44's website:
> Site44 provides the easiest and fastest way to publish files to the web by connecting the contents of a special folder in your Dropbox account to our optimized hosting platform. Changes to files within this Dropbox folder appear on your website within seconds—there are no additional steps to publish your files.

### How-To Install
  1. Go to [Site-44's](http://www.site44.com) homepage.
  2. Click on **Sign in with Dropbox to get started**.
  3. Site-44 will ask permission to allow the app to be connected to your Dropbox.
  4. Click **Allow**.
  5. You'll now be prompted to name your site. Name it something you can remember or will use in the future.
  6. You've successfully installed Site-44, now navigate to the newly made **Apps** folder to get started.

### How to Upload A Website
  1. Login to your Dropbox account if you're not logged in already.
  2. Navigate to your **Apps** folder and then open it *by double clicking*.
  3. There should be a folder icon with a jigsaw puzzle named **site44**, if not then re-install the app by following the **How-To Install** instructions above.
  4. Double click to enter the folder.
  5. You'll now find a folder with the name of your site. *Note: It is also your url.*
  6. Upload your website files within your named folder.
  7. If you notice above, the file directory should be something similar to site44 > yoursite.site44.com. 
  8. Copy that url to view your website.

### Pros
  - It is a free service, just like Dropbox.
  - Can establish password protection for domains.
  - Does include options for monthly payments.
  - Increased storage with payments.
  - Ease of use and upload. 
  - Uses Dropbox as the UI, so navigation isn't an issue.

### Cons
  - Not as secure due to Dropbox not being entirely secure.
  - Limited storage.
  - Is not compatible with PHP. **Static Content Only.**
  - If Dropbox goes down, so does your site.

### Side Notes

  - Just to re-iterate -- **Site-44 DOES NOT support PHP or dynamic content. Static content only.** This does NOT affect responsive web design.

##Drop Pages

Drop Pages Dev:
> I launched DropPages in March 2011 as a side project. I wanted an easy way to create and manage websites quickly and effortlessly. I designed DropPages so that content and presentation are loosly coupled, pages render fast, and templates are easy to manage.

### How-To Install

  1. Go to [Drop Pages](http://www.droppages.com) homepage.
  2. Click on **Getting Started**.
  3. Similar to Site-44's installation, Drop Pages will ask permission to allow the app to be connected to your Dropbox.
  4. Click **Allow**.
  5. Click on **Create New Site**. You'll now be prompted just like Site-44's installation to name your site. 
  6. **IMPORTANT** When naming your site, be sure to type the entire domain. For example, yoursite.droppages.com. If you don't you'll only get errors and won't be able to proceed.
  7. Now you'll see your domain name. Click **Publish now** on the right side.
  8. You can now follow that url and be presented with a default "Hello World" page. **It works!**
  
### How to Upload a Website

  1. Login to your Dropbox account if you're not logged in already.
  2. Navigate to your **Apps** folder and then open it *by double clicking*.

  4. Double click to enter the folder.
  5. You'll now find a folder with the name of your site. *Note: It is also your url.*
  6. **Delete ALL the folders before you upload anything to avoid confusion.**
  7. Upload your website files within your named folder.
  8. If you notice above, the file directory should be something similar to My.DropPages > yoursite.site44.com. 
  9. Copy that url to view your website.

### Pros 
  - Free to use. 
  - 50 MB Starting storage space.
  - Comes to $7.61 / month for 1GB of storage. **First month is free.**
  - Very similar to Site-44's usage. 
  - Again, using Dropbox UI for navigation makes things easy to find.
  - Users can use themes to style their sites. 

### Cons
  - The biggest storage they offer is 1GB.
  - Not as secure due to Dropbox not being entirely secure.

##Synkee

From Synkee's Website:

> Synkee is a simple web hosting solution which uses Dropbox to automatically transfer files from user's computer to a remote server without using standard tools such as FTP. We are first and only "PHP on Dropbox" hosting service.

This is the only service I could not experiement nor even remotely try due to the price entry. There is no free option for Synkee, so naturally I am not going to spend money on it. But I could see why someone would. It is a very advanced service compared to the others.

##Pros
- COMPATIBLE WITH PHP
- $69.99 entry point for 5GB - Second most offered storage capacity for that price.
- Security options above the rest.

##Cons
- Heavy price entry. 
- If you have no need for php, than you wouldn't need this service considering there are ones that do just as well for FREE.
