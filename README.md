##Synkee

From Synkee's Website:

> Synkee is a simple web hosting solution which uses Dropbox to automatically transfer files from user's computer to a remote server without using standard tools such as FTP. We are first and only "PHP on Dropbox" hosting service.

This is the only service I could not experiement nor even remotely try due to the price entry. There is no free option for Synkee, so naturally I am not going to spend money on it. But I could see why someone would. It is a very advanced service compared to the others.

##Pros
- COMPATIBLE WITH PHP
- $69.99 entry point for 5GB - Second most offered storage capacity for that price.
- Security options above the rest.

##Cons
- Heavy price entry. 
- If you have no need for php, than you wouldn't need this service considering there are ones that do just as well for FREE.
