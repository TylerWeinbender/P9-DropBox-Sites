##Services

[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) along with [Site-44](http://www.site44.com), [Drop Pages](http://www.droppages.com), [KISSr](http://www.kissr.com), (with the exception of [Synkee](http://www.synkee.com)) can be used as web hosting tools for those of us who are unable to afford and or hesitate to use/buy web hosting services (me included).

This is a short, compiled list of each service which includes how to install along with their pros and cons respectively.

##DropBox

  5. Enjoy your site!

###Pros
  - Dropbox is free for anyone. 
  - Ease of use, i.e. Drag and drop files for site to work.
  - Dropbox UI is easily navigatable. 
  - No third party software.

###Cons

##Site-44



###How-To Install
  1. Go to [Site-44's](http://www.site44.com) homepage.
  2. Click on **Sign in with Dropbox to get started**.
  3. Site-44 will ask permission to allow the app to be connected to your Dropbox.
  4. Click **Allow**.
  5. You'll now be prompted to name your site. Name it something you can remember or will use in the future.
  6. You've successfully installed Site-44, now navigate to the newly made **Apps** folder to get started.

###How to Upload A Website
  1. Login to your Dropbox account if you're not logged in already.
  2. Navigate to your **Apps** folder and then open it *by double clicking*.
  3. There should be a folder icon with a jigsaw puzzle named **site44**, if not then re-install the app by following the **How-To Install** instructions above.
  4. Double click to enter the folder.
  5. You'll now find a folder with the name of your site. *Note: It is also your url.*
  6. Upload your website files within your named folder.
  7. If you notice above, the file directory should be something similar to site44 > yoursite.site44.com. 
  8. Copy that url to view your website.

###Pros
  - It is a free service, just like Dropbox.
  - Can establish password protection for domains.
  - Does include options for monthly payments.
  - Increased storage with payments.
  - Ease of use and upload. 
  - Uses Dropbox as the UI, so navigation isn't an issue.

###Cons
  - Not as secure due to Dropbox not being entirely secure.
  - Limited storage.
  - Is not compatible with PHP. **Static Content Only.**
  - If Dropbox goes down, so does your site.

###Side Notes
  - When uploading revised files to your site44, your new content will **ONLY be displayed once refreshed.**
  - Just to re-iterate -- **Site-44 DOES NOT support PHP or dynamic content. Static content only.** This does NOT affect responsive web design.

##Drop Pages

###How-To Install

  1. Go to [Drop Pages](http://www.droppages.com) homepage.
  2. Click on **Getting Started**.

  4. Click **Allow**.
  5. Click on **Create New Site**. You'll now be prompted just like Site-44's installation to name your site. 
  6. **IMPORTANT** When naming your site, be sure to type the entire domain. For example, yoursite.droppages.com. If you don't you'll only get errors and won't be able to proceed.
  7. Now you'll see your domain name. Click **Publish now** on the right side.
  8. You can now follow that url and be presented with a default "Hello World" page. **It works!**
